/**
 * HINTS:
 * 1. For the repo issues, be sure to return just the response, and not the actual data.
 * 2. For the repo issues, you'll need to pass in the repo
 * 3. The URL for getting repos by topics looks like this:
 *  'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=javascript+is:featured&sort=help-wanted-issues'
 * 4. The URL for getting issues looks like this:
 * 'https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues?direction=asc'
 * Note that 'facebook/react' is the repo name (you can just use one parameter for this)
 * 5. The URL for getting a user's repos looks like this:
 * 'https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME/repos'
